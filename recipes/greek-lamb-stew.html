    <p>
      Greek lamb stew is a delicious Mediterranean dish that combines tender
      pieces of lamb with a blend of vegetables, herbs, and a rich tomato-based
      sauce. Infused with traditional Greek flavors like garlic, oregano, and
      cinnamon, this stew is hearty and aromatic, making it a perfect choice for
      comforting family dinners or special gatherings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slow-cooked to perfection, the lamb becomes succulent and tender while the
      vegetables absorb the savory flavors of the broth. Paired with crusty
      bread, rice, or orzo, Greek lamb stew delivers a warm, satisfying meal
      that is as flavorful as it is nourishing.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Cut the lamb into bite-sized
          pieces and season with salt and pepper. Chop all the vegetables and
          set them aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat
          olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the lamb pieces and sear on all
          sides until browned. Remove the meat and set it aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In the same pot, add diced onions
          and minced garlic. Sauté for 2–3 minutes until softened and fragrant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Add Vegetables and Tomato Paste:</strong> Stir in the carrots
          and potatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, then add the tomato paste and cook
          for another minute to enhance the flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Combine Liquids and Herbs:</strong> Return the browned lamb to
          the pot. Add diced tomatoes, red wine (if using), broth, oregano,
          cinnamon, and bay leaf. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a
          boil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          <strong>Simmer the Stew:</strong> Reduce the heat to low, cover the
          pot, and let it simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The
          lamb should become tender, and the flavors should meld beautifully.
