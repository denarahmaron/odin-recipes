      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of pasta sheets, rich
      meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and gooey cheese. This hearty dish combines
      the comforting flavors of savory herbs, tangy tomato sauce, and melted
      cheese, making it a favorite for family dinners and gatherings.

      With each layer meticulously built and baked to perfection, lasagna
      delivers a perfect blend of textures and flavors. The top layer of golden,
      bubbling cheese adds the finishing touch, making this dish both a visual
      and culinary delight.

          ingredients.

          <strong>Cook the Meat Sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a pan over
          medium heat. Add the ground beef or sausage and cook until browned.
          Add onions and garlic, sautéing until softened. Stir in tomato sauce,
          diced tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper.

          sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna sheets,
          followed by meat sauce, béchamel, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and
          Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used,
          finishing with a generous layer of cheese on top.

          for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes,
          or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
