    <p>
      Bison stew is a hearty and flavorful dish that combines tender chunks of
      bison meat with a medley of vegetables and rich, savory broth. Known for
      its lean and slightly sweet flavor, bison is a fantastic alternative to
      beef and provides a nutritious, protein-packed meal. This stew is perfect
      for cozy dinners or meal preps, offering warmth and satisfaction in every
      bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slow-cooked to perfection, the stew allows the bison meat to become
      incredibly tender while soaking up the flavors of aromatic herbs, spices,
      and the natural sweetness of root vegetables. It's a comforting dish that
      captures the essence of rustic cooking, ideal for family gatherings or as
      a standalone meal during colder months.

    <h2>Steps to Make Bison Stew</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Cut the bison meat into
          bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper. Chop all the
          vegetables and set them aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat
          olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the bison meat and sear on all
          sides until browned. Remove the meat and set it aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In the same pot, add diced onions
          and minced garlic. Sauté for 2–3 minutes until softened and fragrant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Add Vegetables and Tomato Paste:</strong> Stir in the carrots,
          potatoes, and celery. Cook for about 5 minutes, then add the tomato
          paste and cook for another minute to enhance the flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Combine Liquids and Herbs:</strong> Return the browned bison
          meat to the pot. Add diced tomatoes, beef or bison broth, thyme,
          rosemary, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Simmer the Stew:</strong> Reduce the heat to low, cover the
          pot, and let it simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. This
          allows the meat to become tender and the flavors to meld.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Adjust Thickness:</strong> If desired, mix cornstarch with
          cold water and stir it into the stew. Let it cook for another 5
          minutes until thickened.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Season and Serve:</strong> Taste the stew and adjust seasoning
          with salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot with crusty bread or over a
          bed of rice. Enjoy!
